# bling-data-extraction
Using the Bling ERP API these notebooks treat the sales data of a t-shirt brand stored in Bling ERP. There are 3 notebooks:
1) Relatórios Vendas - Extracts the sales data and create plots with exploratory analysis on the data such as size, models and colors of the t-shirts sold.
2) Acompanhamento dos Pedidos - Generates an excel sheet that summarizes all orders in a single tab and provide fast access to the informations of clients, items sold, status of the orders, invoices and logistics.
3) Separação dos Pedidos em Andamento - The t-shirt brand uses a MTO (make to order) production approach, so there is only a plain t-shirts, tank tops and hoodies stock and not a final stock with the products of all models.As orders are received the products are printed with the models that the clients have chosen. The orders with status "Em Andamento" are the ones that have not been printed yet. This notebook generates sheets with all models that need to be printed for t-shirts, men and women tank tops and hoodies. Also, tables with the sizes and colors of plain t-shirts, hoodies and tank tops are created in order to allow the picking of these items in the stock for printing.
